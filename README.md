# 🧠 ChronoMorph-Core

ChronoMorph-Core is the distilled engine of the ChronoMorph Vault—a cognitive simulation platform for agent orchestration, mutation tracking, and entropy-guided memory visualization.

## 🚀 Components

- `chrono_api.py` — FastAPI server for agent simulation and memory.
- `chrono_gui.py` — Streamlit dashboard for interactive control.
- `utils/` — Audio, entropy, export, mutation, and visualization utilities.
- `replit_agent_helper.py` — CLI tool for agent spawning and monitoring.
- `admin_panel.py` — Local admin diagnostics UI.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start_chronomorph.py
```

## 🧰 Admin Panel

Run this for internal logs, memory traces, and leaderboard stats:

```bash
python admin_panel.py
```

## 🔧 Author

Crafted with recursion and entropy, powered by cognitive glyphs.
